              The first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat">cat</a> in space was a French cat named <em>Felicette</em> (a.k.a. “Astrocat”) In 1963, France blasted the cat <em><strong>into outer space</strong></em>. Electrodes implanted in her brains sent neurological signals back to Earth. She survived the trip.            </p>

              The term “puss” is the root of the principal word for “cat” in the Romanian term pisica and the root of secondary words in Lithuanian (puz) and Low German puus. Some scholars suggest that “puss” could be imitative of the hissing sound used to get a cat’s attention. As a slang word for the female pudenda, it could be associated with the connotation of a cat being soft, warm, and fuzzy.

          <div class="post-content">
            <p>
              All dogs can be traced back 40 million years ago to a weasel-like animal called the Miacis which dwelled in trees and dens. The Miacis later evolved into the Tomarctus, a direct forbear of the genus Canis, which includes the wolf and jackal as well as the dog.
            </p>

              Ancient Egyptians revered their dogs. When a pet dog would die, the owners shaved off their eyebrows, smeared mud in their hair, and mourned aloud for days.
